# Kiosk

_Bookmarks sharing. Anytime. Anywhere._

Current Version: **0.2**

Kiosk helps sharing web pages between collaborators by generating a common RSS feed. The contribution is managed thanks to API keys and requires no peculiar install or configuration client-side other than a bookmarklet.

Kiosk features an optional IRC bot which intercepts `!pr <url>` on a given channel.

Note that there is no user interface enabling to manage shared pages.
